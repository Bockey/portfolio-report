                <p class="more-white-space">Changes I made:</p> 
                <p>1) Design: </p>
                <p class="more-white-space">Images size - I made them smaller which gave better overview (nicer look, more white space, better fitting all screens). 
                    Menu font size - Made it smaller so it looks nicer and easier to read.  
                    On product page - Also made images smaller, aligned description text, change its position. I did this to give cleaner look to the page, and to make user experience more pleasant.  
                    Mini banners on home page - Changed some margin and padding values and added hover transition to help user to better understand what they represent and it also looks better.  
                    Sign in and sign out links - Changed the look of them on smaller screens to give more space to user to click on them and divided them clearly from each other. 
                    Overall, I tried to improve the use of white space, paddings and margins, match elements as much as possible to keep consistency (fonts and other things) and made transitions smoother to give better user experience.

                <p>2) Functionality: </p>
                <p>Hamburger menu - I removed CSS hack we used before learning JavaScript and changed it with script. Also, I made some smaller style changes. 
                   Sign in and sign-up forms - I fixed form validation on these two forms.

                <p>1) Design: </p>
                <p class="less-white-space">Feedback:</p>
                <p>   
                    Menu text on hover color was black and hard to read so I changed it. 
                    Changed bright colours of headings text and also font family of whole text so it is easier to read and more pleasant to the eyes. 
                    Fixed size of sections on home page so they match better rest of the site.  
                    Changed vh and vw units to px, article tags replaced with section. 
                    Removed nav tags from contact form (Originally used CSS hack to open and close the form and unfortunately decided to use nav tag as well). 
                    On Explore.html some h2 tags were closed with h3 so I fixed that. 
                    I removed hyphens from alt text so they are readable now.

                <p class="more-white-space">
                    Home page was too wide on mobile screens. I realised it was from h1 so I fixed that. 
	                I simplified all the animations so they don't disturb user. 
	                I changed landing image on home page. Original one was too busy and made all text on it hard to read.  
	                Overall, I made many smaller changes, organised all the code a little better, tried to improve use of white space.  
                </p>
                <p>2) Functionality: </p>
                <p class="more-white-space">
                    Hamburger menu - I removed CSS hack we used before learning JavaScript and changed it with script. 
	                Contact us - I added form validation to it and replaced CSS hack with JavaScript to open it. 
	                Overall - I simplified design a lot, but would like also to change some colors and most of the images to make it even cleaner. Also, would like to clean the code more (use of id's and classes the most) if I have more time.

                    Here was a little different case. I still didn't get my feedback so I made only some small changes. I already did level 2 things so it wasn't much I could add to it for now.  
                </p>
                <p class="more-white-space">Changes I made:</p>
                <p>
                    I added current class to the menu so user knows at every moment where he is on the site. 
                    Labels and error messages on contact us page were pushing rest of the content when they appear so I fixed that with use of position absolute.  
                    I removed also Hotjar data from all pages. I delivered my site before it was said on the group so it left there.
